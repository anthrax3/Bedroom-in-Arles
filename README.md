# Bedroom in Arles Sublime Text Color Scheme

Here's a quite light and simple theme. 

The main colors of the theme have been extracted from the famous [Bedroom in Arles]("http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedroom_in_Arles") painting of Vincent van Gogh. I've been using the particular color scheme for many years now and I think it is great for text editors too. 

Although most developers tend to use dark themes, I think this one can work for many people.

It works with Sublime Text 2.

## Screenshots

See the colors in a CSS and in an HTML file.

## Installation

The following instructions have to do with Sublime Text 2 only. The particular color scheme has *not* been tested in other versions of ST.

### On a Mac
* After downloading the theme, copy it and go to ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/Color Scheme/Default. Paste the theme in that directory.
* In Sublime Text 2, go to Preferences > Settings - User
* Add the line
{
  "color_scheme": "Packages/Color Scheme - Default/roominarles.tmTheme",
}
