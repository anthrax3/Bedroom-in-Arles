# Bedroom in Arles Sublime Text Color Scheme

Here's a quite light and simple theme. 

The main colors of the theme have been extracted from the famous [Bedroom in Arles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedroom_in_Arles "View the painting on Wikipedia") painting of Vincent van Gogh. I've been using the particular color scheme for many years now and I think it is great for text editors too. Although most developers tend to use dark themes, you might want to give it a chance.

The particular color scheme works with Sublime Text 2. It hasn't been tested with any other software or any other version of Sublime Text.
